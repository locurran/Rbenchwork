## BestRAD
While not the simplest of the RADseq library preparations, the bestRAD portion of the Rapture protocol introduced by [Ali et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/202/2/389/5930231?login=true) has been a popular choice in fisheries genetic studies, as well as those of other taxa. Its performance was favorably reviewed in the [Rochette et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15253) paper introducing the bioinformatics package Stacks 2.

## Workflow
The protocol has been described as a three-day operation. Accordingly, this version is broken down into three documents. Up to six libraries, however, have been started at one time for the plating stage and kept at some level of sync for the rest. Typically, libraries were carried through the rest of the prep two at a time, given the availability of two PCR machines.

## Caveats
If one were to compare bestRAD protocols from sources such as protocols.io, a diversity of choices at various steps will manifest itself, such as input quantities of DNA and number of PCR cycles at the final Illumina prep stage. Investigators will want particular levels of coverage and densities of markers. This protocol, then, is only your starting point.
