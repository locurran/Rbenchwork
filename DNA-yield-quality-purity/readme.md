## Intro
Sample input should be normalized for DNA input quantity in multiplexed RADseq libraries and, preferably, be comparable in average fragment length. (In contrast, diversity might be advisable in other aspects, such as source population, where a study incorporates several libraries.) Confirming purity keeps contaminants from interfering with downstream enzymatic reactions.

## Metrics

- Measuring yield, or concentration, for > 20 samples is best done by fluorescence in a plate reader, with all plates in a study preferably compared in a single run with the same standard.
- Testing quality, or fragment size, might be done by gel electrophoresis against a ladder or by tapestation.
- Ensuring purity, or lack of contaminants, is simply done by absorbance.

## Plate reader quantitation
Quantitation of yield as described is performed on a Biotek Synergy plate reader with Picogreen.

Serial dilution of lambda stock for standard helps in achieving a high R2 on the standard curve. This version weights the dilutions to fall more in the expected range of concentrations of DNA sampled.
