## Intro
Samples should match in DNA input quantities for multiplexed RADseq libraries and, preferably, be comparable in average fragment length. (In contrast, diversity might be advisable in other aspects, such as source population, where a study incorporates several libraries.)

## Metrics

- Measuring yield, or concentration, for > 20 samples is best done by fluorescence in a plate reader, with all plates in a study preferably compared in a single run with the same standard.
- Testing quality, or fragment size, might be done by gel electrophoresis against a ladder or by tapestation.
- Ensuring purity, or lack of contaminants, is simply done by absorbance.
