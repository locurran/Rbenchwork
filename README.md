# Rbenchwork
Lab protocols (mostly) developed in Rmarkdown for population genetics and similar applications

## Intro
I recently (Sept 2021) wrapped up a series of DNA extractions with associated quality checks and RADseq library preparations in the course of pursuing a masters in fisheries science at Oregon State University. This gave me the chance to iteratively refine the benchwork protocols that I adapted to my purposes (nothing's new under the sun). These mostly employ Rmarkdown using the Tidyverse flavor of R to produce pdf output that serves as step-by-step reference while at the bench. Some data management pipelines may be useful as well.

## Upcoming
Give me a week or two (October) to start sharing these!
