## Scope

These protocols have been developed with fish fin clips in mind-dried or in ethanol. Plants, obviously, get their own protocol. Beetles may need mechanical tissue lyzing. DNA-rich tissues would require lower input quantities.

## Plates, spin columns, and micro-spin columns
Most extractions made have been by 96-well microplate. Individual spin-columns allow for more careful pipetting, e.g., taking eluate and leaving precipitates behind. Micro-spin columns in concert with carrier RNA were used successfully with input quantities < 2 mg.

## References

Qiagen blood-and-tissue kits are employed, and their user manuals are the primary source of information. Some elements of NEB Monarch protocols, however, have been incorporated.
